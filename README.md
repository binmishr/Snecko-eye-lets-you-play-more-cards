# Snecko-eye-lets-you-play-more-cards

Over the past strange year, I sunk a lot of time into Slay the Spire, a rogue-like deck-building game. You have to escape from a 50-floor spire, fighting monsters by playing cards. The cards let you attack, defend, apply buffs and debuffs, draw cards, etc. You start each turn with a given amount of energy, the cards cost energy (with the more impactful effects costing more energy), so you need to plan out how to play your turns in order to defeat the monsters. You receive more cards from winning battles and can receive special relics that will make you stronger or change how your deck plays.

Thatâ€™s the basic gist of the game. The sublime part comes when the cards and relics start synergistically empowering each other and comboing off each other. You might get the curse Pain which drains you of 1 health every time you play a card. (This is bad.) But then you find a Rupture which increases your strength every time you take damage from a card. Then you get Runic Cube which draws you a card every time you take damage. Finally, you find Reaper which converts damage into health. So you now have this card-drawing, strength-building, self-sustaining engine that makes you unstoppable. (This particular scenario unfolded in a recent game by the streamer Jorbs.)
